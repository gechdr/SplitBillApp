## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data stored online?</strong></summary>

No, all data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. Nothing is sent to any server.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this offline?</strong></summary>

The app requires an internet connection for initial load (to fetch React, Tailwind, and Tesseract.js from CDN). After loading, most features work offline except OCR scanning.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How accurate is the receipt scanner?</strong></summary>

OCR accuracy depends on image quality and receipt format. It works best with clear, well-lit photos of printed receipts. Always review and adjust detected items before using.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I add more languages?</strong></summary>

Yes! See the [Configuration](#adding-new-languages) section for instructions on adding new translations.
